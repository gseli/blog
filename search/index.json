[{"content":"In 2015 I moved in with my now husband Robert and in the course of almost 6 years so many things have happened in my life.\nI got married, moved houses 2 times, addopted a dog, had a brief streaming career, discovered I have ADHD, changed jobs and took very serious my life career, which will be the main topics of future post.\nNaturally with all these changes in my life and the different focus I had over the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve amassed a very diverse amount of stuff that go from lighting sets (my streamer period) to jewelry making equipment.\nA combination of finding the minimalism trend and trying to manage my own sporadic impulsive buying, Ive made the conscious effort of not too many things, but even so I still find myself surrounded by random mini mountains of stuff around my house, stuff I don\u0026rsquo;t even recognize or use anymore so I decided to make an inventory of how many things I own and only keep what I really like or need.\nMy husband and I decided this week that we are going to actually gather all of our stuff in a huge pile and see how many things we have around the house and do some some of massive spring cleaning, I undestood that not only my personal belongings but our shared things too needed this sorting.\nI\u0026rsquo;m really eager to see how many things we actually own both as individuals and as a couple, and I hope that by the end of that massive endeavor we have appointed ourselves for I can make the number of things I own no more than one hundred.\nWhy one hundred? It seems like and arbitrary number and it kinda is, I came across the concept of people living with the minimalism lifestyle reducing their own items to a hundred or less.\nI wonder how many things I own and if I really need more than a hundred to live and lead the happy life I imagine.\n","date":"2021-04-03T01:10:58.128Z","image":"https://thisismy.blog/p/how-many-things-do-i-own/robert-bye-by34glow7wa-unsplash_hu7a027ed5a9846fe568d15b06eff9f904_2782355_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://thisismy.blog/p/how-many-things-do-i-own/","title":"How many things do I own?"}]
