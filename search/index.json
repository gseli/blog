[{"content":"In 2015 I moved in with Robert, who\u0026rsquo;s now my husband, and in 6 years, so many things have happened in my life.\nI got married, moved houses two times, adopted a dog, had a brief streaming career, discovered I have ADHD, changed jobs, and started taking my life career very seriously.Â Naturally, with all these changes in my life and the different focus I had over the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve amassed a very diverse amount of stuff that goes from lighting sets (my streamer period) to jewelry-making equipment.\nWith a combination of finding the minimalism trend and trying to manage my sporadic impulsive buying, I\u0026rsquo;ve made the conscious effort of not too many things. However, I still find myself surrounded by random mini-mountains of stuff around my house, things I don\u0026rsquo;t even recognize or use anymore. Hence, I decided to inventory how many things I own and only keep what I like or need.\nMy husband and I decided this week that we will gather all of our stuff in a huge pile and see how many things we have around the house and do some massive spring cleaning; I understood that not only my personal belongings but also our shared things too needed this sorting.\nI\u0026rsquo;m eager to see how many things we own both as individuals and as a couple. By the end of that massive endeavor, I hope that we have appointed ourselves, for I can make the number of things I own no more than one hundred.\nWhy one hundred? It seems like an arbitrary number and kind of is. I came across the concept of people living with the minimalist lifestyle reducing their items to a hundred or less.\nI wonder how many things I own and if I need more than a hundred to live and lead the happy life I imagine.\n","date":"2021-04-03T01:10:58.128Z","image":"https://thisismy.blog/p/how-many-things-do-i-own/robert-bye-by34glow7wa-unsplash_hu7a027ed5a9846fe568d15b06eff9f904_2782355_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://thisismy.blog/p/how-many-things-do-i-own/","title":"How many things do I own?"}]
