In 2015 I moved in with Robert, who's now my husband, and in 6 years, so many things have happened in my life.

I got married, moved houses two times, adopted a dog, had a brief streaming career, discovered I have ADHD, changed jobs, and started taking my life career very seriously.Â 

Naturally, with all these changes in my life and the different focus I had over the years, I've amassed a very diverse amount of stuff that goes from lighting sets (my streamer period) to jewelry-making equipment.

With a combination of finding the minimalism trend and trying to manage my sporadic impulsive buying, I've made the conscious effort of not too many things. However, I still find myself surrounded by random mini-mountains of stuff around my house, things I don't even recognize or use anymore. Hence, I decided to inventory how many things I own and only keep what I like or need.

My husband and I decided this week that we will gather all of our stuff in a huge pile and see how many things we have around the house and do some massive spring cleaning; I understood that not only my personal belongings but also our shared things too needed this sorting.

I'm eager to see how many things we own both as individuals and as a couple. By the end of that massive endeavor, I hope that we have appointed ourselves, for I can make the number of things I own no more than one hundred.

Why one hundred? It seems like an arbitrary number and kind of is. I came across the concept of people living with the minimalist lifestyle reducing their items to a hundred or less.

I wonder how many things I own and if I need more than a hundred to live and lead the happy life I imagine.
