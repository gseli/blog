Hey there everyone! 

I enrolled in [Think Tank Training Centre](https://www.tttc.ca)'s Online program last October for those of you who don't know. I'm in my second term, and I chose the Characters for Games path.

These renders are the result of a week and a half of texturing. I was a little too excited and might have gone overboard with the number of renders I did.

The next post will be about creating the texture and my general mindset while doing it.

In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the renders!

My work here is solely on the skin. The hair and eye texturing was given to me as part of the assignment's assets
