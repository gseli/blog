My name is Elizabeth Solis Graniel; welcome to my blog!


Since I was very young, I've had two significant interests: videogames and art. I cannot remember a time in my life when either of those has not been present.


I aim to become a Character Artist, a career that involves both my passions and to take part in creating engaging digital experiences.


For me, technique and technology follow ideas, feelings, and intentions. 


I'm a very energetic and intense individual who would instead tackle big challenges than give up without trying, people know me for being a bit of a bulldozer sometimes, but I take that as a complimentâœ¨
