Since I was very young, I&amp;rsquo;ve had two significant interests: videogames and art. I cannot remember a time in my life when either of those has not been present.
I aim to become a Character Artist, a career that involves both my passions and to take part in creating engaging digital experiences.
For me, technique and technology follow ideas, feelings, and intentions.</description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://thisismy.blog/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thisismy.blog/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://thisismy.blog/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thisismy.blog/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
