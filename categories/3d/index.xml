I enrolled in Think Tank Training Centre&amp;rsquo;s Online program last October for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know. I&amp;rsquo;m in my second term, and I chose the Characters for Games path.
These renders are the result of a week and a half of texturing. I was a little too excited and might have gone overboard with the number of renders I did.
The next post will be about creating the texture and my general mindset while doing it.</description></item></channel></rss>
